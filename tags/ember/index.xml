      <description>Follow with learning more about Ember Js as our JS framework, I have to talk about my learning experience.
When I was searching about Ember I found a lot of resources: posts, books, videos, courses and more. Everything looks good, until I had to start my first projects.
Before to start  I think that is good to know the context about it. Ember JS was born as a fork from SproutCore Framework.</description>

      <description>This is my first post in this year.
Recently we have to develop a project about teacher training for a private university in Mexico City.
There are a lot of javascript frameworks and transpilers: Angular JS, Vue JS, Meteor, Aurelia JS, React JS, Ionic JS, Typescript, CoffeeScript, Elm, etc. We decided learn and use Ember JS for develop our frontend, and Spring/Groovy for the backend.
About Ember Js  Ember is a JavaScript front-end framework designed to help you build websites with rich and complex user interactions.</description>

So I decided talk about Internet of things, because I was learning this using an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi.
DEMO Connect Everything! The project is create a simple web application for create distribuid music. I was inspired in the Launchpad App and the Smartphone Symphony.

I think that the learning experience is a wonderful resource for other persons who are in the same situation, so I consider valuable talk about this. First Steps When I start to learn swift I decide to watch videos and demonstrations about how to use the Xcode for build iOS apps, but, for be honest, I couldnâ€™t understand some things: optionals, constrains, auto layoutâ€¦ This was my first experience.</description></item><item><title>Learning Ember JS</title><link>https://carlogilmar.xyz/posts/learning-ember/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlogilmar.xyz/posts/learning-ember/</guid><description>Follow with learning more about Ember Js as our JS framework, I have to talk about my learning experience.

The Process Work with process in Elixir is so common, so, itâ€™s important know how to use it. For create a process you can use spawn (which takes a function).
The process structure is very simple: you have a mailbox, created within a function and by the word receive, and you can manage different messages and do something.</description></item></channel></rss>

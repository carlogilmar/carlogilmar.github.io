Recently we have to develop a project about teacher training for a private university in Mexico City.
There are a lot of javascript frameworks and transpilers: Angular JS, Vue JS, Meteor, Aurelia JS, React JS, Ionic JS, Typescript, CoffeeScript, Elm, etc. We decided learn and use Ember JS for develop our frontend, and Spring/Groovy for the backend.
About Ember Js Ember is a JavaScript front-end framework designed to help you build websites with rich and complex user interactions.</description></item></channel></rss>
